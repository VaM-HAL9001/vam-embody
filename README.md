# Virt-A-Mate Wrist

Better VR controller alignement in possession mode

## Objectives

- Show the controller position versus the actual hand position to visualize exactly what happens
- Translate and rotate the hand so it better fits the actual hand position (may need to manually "record" multiple positions and interpolate?)
- "Snap" to desired areas, so when the body does not match the controlled model (e.g. longer legs) we can artificially move the hand to the nearest snap area, and interpolate between snaps.
