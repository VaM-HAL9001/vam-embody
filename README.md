# Virt-A-Mate Improved POV Plugin

Improved POV handling so that possession actually feels right.

## How to use

Add the `ImprovedPoV.cs` plugin to the Person you want to possess. Then, add the `ImprovedPoVMirrorReflection` on all mirrors you have in your scene.

You can use the recess and up/down controls to adjust for your specific morphs, and optionally use the "Materials Enabled" option if you don't have a mirror. It will be very slightly more performant.

To adjust the face, you should play with the World Scale. Close your eyes, put your index finger horizontally at the level of your mouth, and look at where it shows up. Increase or decrease the scale so that your "proportions" fit!
